The emergence of AI-assisted software development has fundamentally changed how developers approach complex tasks. Large language models (LLMs) now serve as intelligent assistants for code generation, debugging, documentation, and project planning. However, this paradigm shift introduces a critical challenge: \textit{context persistence across extended development sessions}.

Consider a researcher conducting an ML experiment over several weeks. They work with an AI assistant to design experiments, implement models, and analyze results. Each session begins productively, but interruptions---meetings, context window limits, system restarts---repeatedly force the developer to spend 15--25 minutes re-establishing context~\cite{mark2008cost}. Over a month-long project, this overhead can accumulate to hours of lost productivity.

Current solutions address this problem inadequately. Traditional workflow orchestration systems (Apache Airflow~\cite{hazelwood2018airflow}, Temporal~\cite{temporal2020}, Prefect~\cite{prefect2021}) excel at automated data pipeline execution but lack support for interactive, AI-assisted development workflows. Emerging agent frameworks (LangChain~\cite{chase2022langchain}, AutoGPT~\cite{autogpt2023}, CrewAI~\cite{crewai2023}) provide multi-agent capabilities but suffer from context fragility---restarting often means starting over.

We present the \textbf{Universal Workflow System (UWS)}, a git-native workflow management system designed specifically for context-resilient AI-assisted development. UWS integrates existing concepts in a practical system through three key design decisions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Git-Native State Persistence}: All workflow state is stored in version-controlled YAML files, enabling checkpoint-based recovery, state diffing, and collaborative workflows through standard git operations.

    \item \textbf{Multi-Agent Architecture}: Seven specialized agents (researcher, architect, implementer, experimenter, optimizer, deployer, documenter) handle different workflow phases, with explicit handoff protocols preserving context across transitions.

    \item \textbf{Modular Skill Library}: A catalog of reusable capabilities that agents can dynamically load, enabling adaptation to diverse project types (ML research, LLM development, software engineering).
\end{enumerate}

We evaluate UWS through comprehensive automated benchmarks, comparing context recovery performance against manual workflows (based on literature estimates~\cite{mark2008cost, parnin2011programmer}), LangGraph (measured), and git-only workflows (measured). Our evaluation addresses five research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1 (Functionality)}: Does UWS correctly implement workflow state management across diverse scenarios?
    \item \textbf{RQ2 (Performance)}: How does UWS's context recovery time compare to baseline approaches?
    \item \textbf{RQ3 (Reliability)}: What is UWS's checkpoint recovery success rate under failure conditions?
    \item \textbf{RQ4 (Generalizability)}: Does UWS effectively support different project types?
    \item \textbf{RQ5 (Overhead)}: What is the performance cost of using UWS?
\end{itemize}

Results demonstrate that UWS achieves context recovery in 44ms on average (95\% CI: [43.7, 44.3]). Compared to manual reconstruction (15--25 minutes based on literature~\cite{mark2008cost}), this represents $>$99.99\% reduction in mechanical recovery overhead. Reliability testing shows 100\% checkpoint recovery success under controlled failure injection. We acknowledge important limitations: LangGraph's in-memory state restore (0.064ms) is faster but addresses a different problem (computation state vs. workflow context), and our manual baseline relies on literature estimates rather than direct measurement.

\paragraph{Contributions} This paper makes the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A git-native state persistence mechanism for development workflow context, integrating version control semantics with structured state management (Section~\ref{sec:approach}).

    \item An open-source implementation of UWS with comprehensive test suite (175 tests, 94\% pass rate) demonstrating practical functionality (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}).

    \item Empirical evaluation with real baseline measurements (LangGraph 1.0.3, git-only) and literature-based comparison (manual recovery), using appropriate non-parametric statistics (Cliff's delta, 95\% CIs) (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}).

    \item A complete replication package including source code, Docker environment, benchmarks, and analysis scripts for reproducibility.
\end{enumerate}
