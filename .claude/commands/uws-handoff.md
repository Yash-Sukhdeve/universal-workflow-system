Prepare a session handoff by updating .workflow/handoff.md with:
1. What was accomplished this session
2. Next priority actions
3. Any blockers or notes

Read the current handoff file first, then update it with the user's provided context.
After updating, create a checkpoint to preserve the handoff state.
